# Reviserr Monolithic SPA

A single-page React app enabling privacy-first, offline/online revision for students.

## Features

- **Secure File Upload**: All files are processed in-browser; no backend involved.
- **Client-Side Extraction**: Extracts text from PDF/DOCX.

- **MCQ Generation**: Supports OpenAI and Cohere APIs; easy to extend.
- **Interactive Quizzing**: With accessibility-first feedback and screen reader support.
- **Offline Support**: Service worker enables static asset caching and offline quizzes.
- **Privacy-first**: No data leaves user's browser except direct LLM calls.
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast, keyboard navigable UI.
- **Robust Error Handling**: UI displays errors and banners for issues (API, extraction, etc).

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
